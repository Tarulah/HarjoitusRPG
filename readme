This is just a small project intended for practising Unity and C# more. It’s intended to be a pretty generic RPG game. It’s still in progress. 
At the moment there is movement, simple animation, some sort of combat system which is not finished completely yet and one enemy who does nothing at the moment. 
Quest Manager has already been started and the player can already receive their first quest but it cannot be finished yet. 
There are also some 3D models added from Unity asset store.
